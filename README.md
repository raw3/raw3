# raw3
A complete TypeScript NodeJS + Angular Universal (v8) PWA application. This one serves my own website.

## Installing
- Run `git clone https://github.com/raw3/raw3.git` in a folder of your choosing.

## Running
- Open a new terminal and run `yarn watch:ssr` to run and watch the back-end;
- Run `yarn watch` to run and watch the front-end;
- Navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser.

## Developing
- After back-end changes, nodemon should automatically pick them up;
- After front-end changes, type `rs` in the watch:ssr runner to reload the server so SSR works properly.
